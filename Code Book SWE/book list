I think one of the best things that Engineering Schools teach us is to be self-learners. Here are 5 Must-Read Books for Every Software Engineer:

1. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
2. Clean Architecture: A Craftsmanâ€™s Guide to Software Structure and Design
3. The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers
4. Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
5. Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software

Keep improving your game!
